A quick test before interviewing with Hailo:

	"Develop a program that, given a series of points (latitude,longitude,timestamp) for a cab journey from A-B, will disregard potentially erroneous points. Try to demonstrate a knowledge of Object Oriented concepts in your answer. Your answer must be returned as a single PHP file which can be run against the PHP 5.3 CLI. The attached dataset is provided as an example, with a png of the 'cleaned' route as a guide."

Code:
	clean_route.php

Data:
	points.csv		- source data
	cleaned.png		- given example of the cleansed route
	noise.csv		– points removed by the solution script 
	signal.csv		– points from the original dataset with noise ones removed by the solution script

	Same data on Google Fusion Tables (so can it can easily viewed on a map):
